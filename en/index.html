  <p>
    At some point in my life, i wanted to show my photos to individuals outside the realm of friends and famiily. <br>
    I tried instagram, but soon i felt, the platform is'n really used very much for experiencing creative work, <br>
    but more whatching people's lifes. <br>
    my life isn't very exciting, and i don't care much about the life's of others.<br>
    and then, a photography magazine contacted me, and asked, if i would like to be featured. I was exited. <br>
    The only problem was, they only accept submits, if you got a Homepage. <br>
    so, i baught a book about webdesigns, thaught, it can't be too hard to write one myself. <br>
    that was half a year ago. I still have no idea, what i'm doing, but webdesign is fun and refreshing somehow.
    now i'm writing this page, and thinking about becomeing a webdesigner, because i like doing it.
